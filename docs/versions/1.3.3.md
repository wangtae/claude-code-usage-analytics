# Version 1.3.3

**Release Date**: 2025-10-21

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed UnboundLocalError in Dashboard Rendering
- **Fixed crash with error: "cannot access local variable 'Panel' where it is not associated with a value"**
- Removed redundant import statement that was shadowing the global import

## Changes

### Dashboard Error Handling
- Removed duplicate `from rich.panel import Panel` import inside exception handler (line 495)
- The Panel class is already imported at the module level (line 7)
- This redundant import created a local variable scope issue that caused the UnboundLocalError

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/visualization/dashboard.py`
  - Removed redundant import at line 495 inside the `sqlite3.OperationalError` exception handler
  - Panel and Text are already imported at the top of the file

### Problem Symptoms (Now Fixed)
When running `ccu`:
```
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'Panel' where it is not associated with a value
  File "/src/visualization/dashboard.py", line 586, in render_dashboard
    usage_content = Panel(
                    ^^^^^
```

### Root Cause
Python's variable scoping rules:
- When Python sees `from rich.panel import Panel` anywhere inside a function, it treats `Panel` as a local variable for the entire function
- The redundant import was inside an exception handler (line 495)
- When the normal execution path reached line 586 (outside the exception), it tried to use `Panel` before it was assigned
- This caused an `UnboundLocalError` because Python knew `Panel` was local but it hadn't been assigned yet in that execution path

### Solution
- Removed the redundant `from rich.panel import Panel` and `from rich.text import Text` imports from the exception handler
- Both classes are already imported at the module level and don't need to be re-imported

## Compatibility

No breaking changes. This is a critical bug fix that prevents the application from crashing on startup.
