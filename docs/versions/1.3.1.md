# Version 1.3.1

**Release Date**: 2025-10-21

## Improvements

### Enhanced Precision in Recommended Usage Calculations
- **Minute-based calculations** for more accurate real-time tracking
- **Improved precision** for both session and weekly limits

## Changes

### Session Limit Calculation (5 hours)
- Changed from hour-based to minute-based calculation
- Now uses 300 minutes instead of 5 hours for calculations
- Updates every minute for more responsive guidance
- Example: 30 minutes elapsed → 10%, 90 minutes → 30%

### Weekly Limit Calculation
- Changed from hour-based to minute-based calculation
- Now uses 10,080 minutes (7 days) instead of 168 hours
- Provides more granular progress tracking
- Example: 1,440 minutes (1 day) → 14.29%

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/visualization/dashboard.py`
  - `_calculate_session_recommended_pct()` - Now uses minutes
  - `_calculate_weekly_recommended_pct()` - Now uses minutes

### Implementation
```python
# Before (hour-based)
elapsed_hours = elapsed.total_seconds() / 3600
recommended_pct = (elapsed_hours / 5) * 100

# After (minute-based)
elapsed_minutes = elapsed.total_seconds() / 60
recommended_pct = (elapsed_minutes / 300) * 100
```

## Benefits

- **Real-time updates**: Recommended usage updates every minute
- **Better accuracy**: Especially important for 5-hour session limits
- **Consistent precision**: Both session and weekly limits use same granularity
- **Improved UX**: Users get more responsive and accurate guidance

## Compatibility

No breaking changes. This is a calculation improvement that doesn't affect data storage or user settings.
