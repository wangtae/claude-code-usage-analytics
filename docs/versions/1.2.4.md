## üéØ Overview

Version 1.2.4 is a documentation-focused release that clarifies the multi-device aggregation feature in the project title and updates visual demonstrations with improved GIF recordings.

## ‚ú® New Features

None (documentation-only release)

## üîß Changes

### 1. README Title Update
- **Old Title**: "Claude Code Usage Monitor (Multi devices)"

### 3. VHS Script Updates
- **File**: `docs/gifs/08-devices-mode.tape`
- **Change**: Height increased from 830px to 1100px
- **Reason**: Better display of device statistics table

## üìù Technical Details

  - Force browser to reload updated GIF

#### 2. **docs/gifs/08-devices-mode.tape**
- **Line 9**: Changed `Set Height 830` ‚Üí `Set Height 1100`
- **Purpose**: Display complete device statistics without scrolling

#### 3. **docs/images/07-heatmap-mode.gif**
- Regenerated with current VHS settings
- No visual changes, just updated recording

#### 4. **docs/images/08-devices-mode.gif**
- Regenerated with new height setting (1100px)

## üêõ Bug Fixes

None (documentation-only release)

## üí° Terminology Clarification

### "Multi-Device Aggregation" vs "Multi-PC Support"

**Multi-Device Aggregation** emphasizes:
- Data from multiple devices is **combined** into a single view
- Total usage across all PCs is **summed** and displayed
- Historical data from all devices is **aggregated** in one dashboard

**Multi-PC Support** (still accurate but less descriptive):
- Tool works across multiple computers
- Data syncs between devices
- Per-device statistics available

The new title "Multi-Device Aggregation" better communicates the **value proposition**: users can see their **total** Claude Code usage across all their computers in one unified dashboard.

## üöÄ Migration Notes

- No breaking changes
- No database schema changes
- No code changes
- Existing installations work without modification
- Documentation improvements only

## üìä Use Cases

### Scenario: User Confusion About Feature
**Before v1.2.4:**
- User sees "Multi devices" in title
- Unclear if it means "multi-device support" or "multi-device tracking"
- May not understand that usage is aggregated/summed

**After v1.2.4:**
- User sees "Multi-Device Aggregation"
- Immediately understands: usage from all devices is combined
- Clear value: see total usage across all PCs

### Scenario: Devices Mode Visualization
**Before v1.2.4:**
- Devices mode GIF height: 830px
- Some device statistics may be cut off
- Users need to scroll to see full table

**After v1.2.4:**
- Devices mode GIF height: 1100px
- Complete device statistics visible
- Full table shown without scrolling

## üîç Version Comparison

| Aspect | v1.2.3 | v1.2.4 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Title | "Multi devices" | "Multi-Device Aggregation" |
| Devices GIF Height | 830px | 1100px |
| GIF Cache | No versioning | Cache busting (`?1`) |
| Clarity | Multi-device support | **Aggregation** emphasized |

## üìù Developer Notes

### Documentation Best Practices Applied

1. **Clear Terminology**: "Aggregation" is more descriptive than "devices"
2. **Visual Quality**: Regenerated GIFs with optimal settings
3. **Cache Management**: Added cache busting for updated assets
4. **Consistency**: All GIF demonstrations now follow uniform standards

### VHS Script Standards

All VHS tape files now maintain consistent settings:
- Font size appropriate for content density
- Width: 1200px (standard)
- Height: Adjusted per view (800-1300px)
- Theme: "Dracula" (consistent branding)
- Padding: 10px (clean borders)

## üéâ Acknowledgments

This release improves documentation clarity based on user feedback and ensures visual demonstrations accurately represent the tool's multi-device aggregation capabilities.

## üì∏ Documentation Changes Summary

**Updated:**
- README.md title (1 line)
- docs/gifs/08-devices-mode.tape (1 setting)
- docs/images/07-heatmap-mode.gif (regenerated)
- docs/images/08-devices-mode.gif (regenerated with new height)

**Impact:**
